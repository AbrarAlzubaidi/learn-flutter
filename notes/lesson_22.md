## what dart do when you click on run?

1. typically it is analyzing the code inside the `main.dart`` file from top to bottom.
2. the code then compiled by dart and flutter tools. so basically it translated the code into IOS and android machine code.
3. then this code packaged up and bundled together into the executed code that run in the simulator/device.

## notes

- `runApp()` function is a flutter build function. it is the main function should be called so the flutter app will be running.
- in dart to call a function you should call it in an upper function body. so this is the meaning of the `void main` function.
